I, along with another Jewish student here, are working on an app that would help identify the certifications of the different Kashrut agencies. You would be able to scan a symbol on a food item, and it would identify for you the agency behind that symbol, so you can decide if that kashrut is stringent enough for you. There was a similar app on the iPhone app store called The Kosher App, but we are taking it over and updating the machine learning model it uses. We are in the process of gathering data on the different agencies, and we wanted to know if you had images of your certification symbol on different food items that we could use for training data for our neural network image classification model. The more pictures the better as it will take hundreds or thousands of each symbol to operate properly and we as two college students don't have the time or resources to take all those pictures ourselves. Any advice, images, or data would be appreciated!\n\nThanks so much,\nMatthew Rosenberg"
